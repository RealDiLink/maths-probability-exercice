# maths-probability-exercice
This is a short python code that i have created for a maths exercice about probability.

Like i said, i made this project for a maths exercice about probability : 
- This is a short game where you have a hare and a turtle,
- to win :
   - the hare must get 6 with a dice
   - the turtle must get a number other than 6 three times in a row

The purpose of that game was  to determine the probability of the hare and the turtle winning.

**Caution** :
 *I agree that this code is not optimized and well made in general, but I'm still interested for feedback about that !*
